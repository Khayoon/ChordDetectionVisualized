When the winding frequency matches the signal's frequency (in this case, 3 cycles per second), all peaks align on the right and all valleys on the left. This shifts the center of mass unusually far to the right.

To visualize this, we can plot the center of mass for various winding frequencies. Since the center of mass is two-dimensional, it has an x and y coordinate. However, for now, we'll only track its x-coordinate.

For example, at a winding frequency of zero, where everything is grouped on the right, the x-coordinate of the center of mass will be relatively high.
